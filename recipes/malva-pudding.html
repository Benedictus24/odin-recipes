        Description

    This is a tasty South African pudding best served with warm custard. Never tried it? Let
    me not tell you all about it, but let it speak for itself with your palette.

    <h2>
        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon butter
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon apricot jam
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon white vinegar
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon baking soda
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup milk
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup all-purpose flour
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>
    Steps for preparation
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to (200 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch cake pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the sugar, egg, and butter into a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in apricot
            jam, vinegar, and baking soda. Add milk and flour; beat until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the
            prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, this should take
            about 35 minutes.
        </li>

    </ol>
    But wait... remember I said it tastes amazing with custard? So we need to learn how to make our own home made creamy
    custard goodness. So we are not yet done!
    <h3>
        Custard ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            4 cups whole milk
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon vanilla extract

        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon butter

        </li>
        <li>
            4 eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup white sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            3 tablespoons cornstarch
        </li>
    </ul>
        <h3>
     Steps for preparation
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place milk, vanilla extract, and butter in a saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until simmering;
                remove from heat <b>before</b> it comes to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Separate the egg white from the egg white and yolk
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix the egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl until sugar dissolves and creates a yellow
                paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set the saucepan back over low heat. Pour in egg mixture slowly, whisking constantly, until custard
                thickens
                enough to coat the bottom of a spoon this should take about 5 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Just like that we have some top of the range custard to serve with our malva pudding, pour it over our malva
        pudding
        and voila we have some tantalising goodness! Enjoy my friend
